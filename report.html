          <h3>
            Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your
            portfolio site? Describe the version of you that it is about. What
            is the audience you are addressing? What type of structure did you
            choose to implement?
          </h3>

          <p>
            The essential story that I am trying to convey with my portfolio
            website is my experience, projects, and programming journey to my
            audiences. I have created a portfolio website before to showcase my
            projects to potential recruiters. But the website that I have
            created previously is based on a standardized template, and is what
            most people normally have. With my current portfolio website, I wish
            to convey that I have a creative side in me to design and animate
            stuff that is out of the norm, while also maintaining
            standardization and professionalism.
          </p>

          <p>
            The content of this project is given to me to create a portfolio
            website about me in the year 2034. I interpreted this question as a
            common question asked in the interview question, “Where do I see
            myself 10 years down the road,” and decided to create a portfolio
            website based on that. This portfolio website is a version of what I
            plan to achieve, as well as where I want to be in the future. This
            means that I will have more skillsets, more hours into programming
            and projects, and most importantly, more experience working in
            reputable companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main audience that I wish to address is potential recruiters
            looking to hire me. As my resume alone makes it hard to tell what I
            am capable of doing, I wish to use this portfolio website to
            showcase my ability to create fun and interactive websites, while
            also being able to showcase my other projects, such as machine
            learning and data science. I also want to showcase my programming
            journey, to show what contribution I have made to previous
            employers. While the main audience is recruiters or employers, I
            also cater this website to people who are just curious about who I
            am and what I can do, or people who are just starting programming. I
            wish to inspire them by showing my ability and past work.
          </p>

          <p>
            The structure of my site is a linked structure, where one page
            cross-links to one another. When the audience first visits my
            website, they will be greeted with my hero section on my home page,
            which is visually appealing and interactive, as it features a
            parallax scrolling, just to add some fun to my website. It will then
            provide a summary about me to indicate why recruiters should choose
            me, as well as my testimonials. Depending on what the audience
            clicks, they will be brought to either my portfolio page or the
            about me page. The About Me page shows my journey, which includes my
            experience and education. Below are the skills I have learned, such
            as frameworks or programming languages, and the services that I am
            capable of.
          </p>

          <p>
            My portfolio page shows the featured projects I have done, and
            audiences can click on them to get more information. The information
            will be presented in a pop-up. Through the nav link, audiences are
            then able to navigate to my blog page, which shows how I keep
            updated on technology. If the audience is interested based on what I
            did, they can contact me through the Contact Me page, which provides
            all my social media, my resume, my email, or just message me through
            the website.

          </h3>

          <p>
            I spend a lot of time researching another professional website that
            offers interactive animations as well as eye-catching designs to
            attract audiences. I managed to find three websites that I liked the
            best, as they provide cool animation and unique design.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.adhamdannaway.com/contact."
              >Adhamdannaway Website</a
            >
            My website is heavily inspired by his hero section on each page. I
            think it’s a very clean and unique design and it is capable of
            attracting the audience’s attention. I also like the way he
            structures his contact Me, and blog page, as it is very structured
            and well-presented
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.codewonders.dev/projects"
              >Codewonders Website</a
            >
            inspired my portfolio page, as I knew I wanted to create something
            using the 2024 web trend bento box UI, and his website was able to
            do that. I also like how the project will show more details when
            clicked, similar to how I did the pop-up
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://tamalsen.dev/">Tamalsen Website</a> is another that
            inspired my portfolio page, I like the way he presented in a fun
            bento box UI, but also how each project card is clean, showing only
            the title as well as the topic. Another cool feature is that the
            topic will change to a “show project” text when you hover over it,
            offering interactivity for the audience.

          <h3>
            Accessibility: State 3 ways in which your site is accessible to
            those with different abilities and needs (for example those with
            visual impairment)
          </h3>

          <p>
            The first accessibility feature I implemented is a flexible layout
            and adaptable viewport. To ensure the site is accessible across
            different devices and screen sizes, I designed it to fluidly adapt
            to three main viewports: desktop, tablet, and mobile. Instead of
            relying on fixed pixel sizes, I used flexible CSS units like
            percentages, vw (viewport width), and vh (viewport height), allowing
            the site to scale appropriately for different screen sizes. This
            flexibility is particularly helpful for users who depend on screen
            magnifiers or use devices with various resolutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second accessibility feature I implemented is enhanced screen
            reader support through semantic HTML. I applied accessibility best
            practices, such as including descriptive alt attributes for all
            images and using appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet
            Applications) labels, to ensure key elements are accessible to
            screen readers. To improve navigability for users with visual
            impairments, I used semantic HTML elements like header, main, nav,
            and article, rather than generic div tags. This approach not only
            makes the content easier for screen readers to interpret but also
            improves the overall structure, making it simpler for users with
            disabilities to understand and navigate the site.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third accessibility feature is keyboard accessibility and focus
            states. Recognising the needs of users with physical disabilities, I
            made sure the website is fully navigable using only a keyboard. The
            "tab" key can be used to move through interactive elements such as
            links, buttons, and forms, ensuring the site is accessible for those
            unable to use a mouse. Additionally, I implemented a focus state
            indicator similar to the hover effect. This provides visual
            feedback, highlighting the currently selected element when
            navigating via keyboard, offering a clear visual cue that enhances
            usability for everyone, particularly those with motor disabilities.
            The focus state helps maintain a consistent user experience and
            makes the site more intuitive for keyboard-only users.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="report_question">
          <h3>
            Usability: State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of
            your site.
          </h3>

          <p>
            The first usability feature I focused on is responsive and intuitive
            navigation with a hamburger menu. I prioritised usability by
            designing a simple, efficient navigation system that adjusts to
            different devices. On desktop, users see a traditional top
            navigation bar, making all sections of the site easily accessible.
            For smaller viewports, like mobile devices, I implemented a
            hamburger menu, allowing users to access navigation through a flyout
            menu. This keeps the interface clutter-free while ensuring ease of
            use. The transition from a desktop navigation bar to a
            mobile-friendly hamburger menu is managed with JavaScript, providing
            a seamless and intuitive experience across all screen sizes. This
            design ensures users can navigate smoothly, regardless of the device
            they’re using.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second usability feature I considered is a high-contrast colour
            scheme for improved readability. To deliver a user-friendly
            experience, I carefully selected the colour scheme and contrast
            throughout the site. I chose three main colours and adjusted their
            brightness levels to distinguish important content from less
            important elements. This high-contrast colour palette enhances
            readability, especially for users with visual impairments or those
            viewing the site in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. By
            consistently applying these colours, I was able to create a visually
            appealing and functional design that balances both usability and
            accessibility. This ensures that text and key elements are clear and
            easy to understand, making the site more intuitive for a wide range
            of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third usability feature I incorporated is light and dark mode
            for a personalised user experience. Another key feature I
            implemented is the option for users to toggle between light and dark
            modes. This choice is easily accessible via a button at the top of
            the page, enabling users to select their preferred mode based on
            their environment or comfort. I thoroughly tested both modes across
            all pages to ensure a consistently positive experience.
            Additionally, I used localStorage to remember the user’s preferred
            mode, so they don't have to reset it every time they visit a new
            page. This provides a more personalised and convenient browsing
            experience, especially for users who frequently switch between light
            and dark environments.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="report_question">
          <h3>
            State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How
            did you achieve that?
          </h3>

          <p>
            The first thing I had to learn was how to implement dynamic content
            loading. At first, I struggled with understanding how to update
            content on the fly without reloading the entire page. I explored
            JavaScript’s DOM manipulation features, and after going through
            several tutorials and documentation, I learned to use functions like
            querySelector and getElementsByTagName to access and update HTML
            elements dynamically. By experimenting with these methods, I was
            able to create a modal that displays different project titles,
            images, and descriptions based on the portfolio card clicked. This
            allowed me to create a more interactive and user-friendly experience
            for my site.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second thing I learned was how to manage multiple event
            listeners in a clean and efficient way. As I added interactivity to
            my site, such as opening a modal when a card is clicked or closing
            it by clicking on various elements, I realised I needed a way to
            handle multiple event listeners without cluttering my code. I took
            the time to study event delegation, learning how it could reduce the
            number of event listeners while still providing the desired
            functionality. I practised by writing JavaScript functions that
            responded to various user actions (like clicking the overlay, close
            buttons, or portfolio cards). With the help of online resources and
            some trial and error, I became comfortable working with events and
            creating modular, scalable code.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third challenge I faced was mastering CSS class manipulation to
            manage UI states. I wanted to control when elements like modals or
            overlays would appear and disappear smoothly. To achieve this, I
            learned to dynamically add and remove CSS classes using JavaScript.
            I read articles and watched tutorials that explained how combining
            CSS animations with JavaScript could enhance the user experience.
            After multiple iterations, I managed to create a seamless modal
            opening and closing effect by toggling the “active” class based on
            user actions. This not only improved the visual aesthetics of the
            site but also made the code more maintainable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="report_question">
          <h3>
            Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were
            particularly successful? Why?
          </h3>

          <p>
            I am particularly proud of the parallax scrolling effect I
            implemented on the main page of my website. This feature stands out
            as a success for several reasons. Firstly, the motion dynamics of
            the image objects, which move in response to the user’s scrolling,
            are smooth and consistent across all viewport sizes. This
            responsiveness ensures a seamless experience regardless of the
            device used, which was one of my main goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            At first, the idea of implementing parallax scrolling felt quite
            daunting. Most of the tutorials I found used preset images with
            backgrounds removed to layer the images effectively and create the
            desired depth. The complexity shown in these tutorials made me
            apprehensive about whether I could replicate such an effect
            successfully.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, as I followed a step-by-step YouTube tutorial, I realised
            that the process was more approachable than I had anticipated.
            Encouraged by this, I went beyond the basic vertical movements
            suggested in the tutorial, incorporating rotations and horizontal
            shifts of the image objects to add complexity and enhance the appeal
            of the effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, I customised the parallax scrolling to reflect personal
            elements, choosing images that resonate with my identity as a proud
            Singaporean and modifying them to fit the theme. The success of this
            feature lies not only in its technical execution but also in how it
            personalises the user experience, maintaining a thematic consistency
            that aligns with the overall design ethos of the site. The positive
            feedback I received confirmed its impact, making it one of the
            highlights of my web development project.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="report_question">
          <h3>
            Evaluation II: What aspects of your work could be improved? How
            might you do things differently another time?
          </h3>

          <p>
            One aspect of my work that I believe could be improved is the pop-up
            effect on my portfolio page. Inspired by the sleek and minimalistic
            pop-ups found on the Apple website, I aimed to replicate their clean
            design and intuitive user experience, particularly the way they
            handle overflowing content. On Apple’s site, when the content within
            a pop-up exceeds the available space, users can scroll down, and the
            entire pop-up moves smoothly to reveal more information.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, in my implementation, I was unable to achieve the same
            effect. Instead of the pop-up moving in response to scrolling, I
            opted for a simpler solution where the content within the pop-up is
            scrollable within a fixed frame. While this approach works
            functionally and maintains a clean design, I feel it lacks the
            fluidity and polish of Apple’s interaction model, where the entire
            pop-up moves as the user scrolls, creating a more seamless
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main challenge I faced was managing content overflow. Although
            the scrollable pop-up I created is a practical solution, it doesn’t
            quite match the refined user experience I had envisioned. In the
            future, I plan to research and experiment with advanced JavaScript
            techniques, such as manipulating the viewport’s scroll event or
            using CSS animations, to create a more dynamic pop-up movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given more time or another opportunity, I would focus on learning
            how to implement this type of scrollable, moving pop-up. This might
            involve a deeper exploration of JavaScript event listeners or CSS
            properties like position: sticky and transform, which could help me
            achieve an effect similar to what Apple has done. By refining this
            feature, I can bring my design closer to the high standard of
            interactivity and user experience that I admire in professional
